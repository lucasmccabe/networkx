"""Functions supporting the computation of the Tutte polynomial of a graph.

The Tutte polynomial `T_G(x, y)` is a fundamental graph polynomial invariant in
two variables. It encodes a wide array of information related to the
edge-connectivity of a graph; "Many problems about graphs can be reduced to
problems of finding and evaluating the Tutte polynomial at certain values" [1]_.
In fact, every deletion-contraction-expressible feature of a graph is a
specialization of the Tutte polynomial [2]_.

For instance, at `y=0`, the Tutte polynomial retrieves the chromatic polynomial.
Some more specializations:
- `T_G(1, 1)` counts the number of spanning trees of `G`
- `T_G(1, 2)` counts the number of connected spanning subgraphs of `G`
- `T_G(2, 1)` counts the number of spanning forests in `G`
- `T_G(0, 2)` counts the number of strong orientations of `G`
- `T_G(2, 0)` counts the number of acyclic orientations of `G`

Practically, up-front computation of the Tutte polynomial may be useful when
users wish to repeatedly calculate edge-connectivity-related information about
one or more graphs. A general treatment of the Tutte polynomial is provided in
[3]_.

    r"""Compute a graph's Tutte polynomial via the classical
    deletion-contraction algorithm.

    The Tutte polynomial `T_G(x, y)` is a fundamental graph polynomial invariant
    in two variables, encoding a wide array of information related to the
    edge-connectivity of a graph. There are several equivalent definitions; here
    are three:

    Def 1 (rank-nullity expansion): For `G` an undirected graph, `n(G)` the
    number of vertices of `G`, `E` the edge set of `G`, and `c(A)`` the number of
    connected components of `A` [1]_:

    .. math::

        T_G(x, y) = \sum_{A \in E} (x-1)^{c(A) - c(G)} (y-1)^{c(A) + |A| - n(G)}

    Def 2 (spanning tree expansion): For `G` an undirected graph, `T` a spanning
    tree of `G`, `i(T)` the internal activity of `T`, and `e(T)` the external
    activity of `T` [2]_:

    .. math::

        T_G(x, y) = \sum_{T \text{ a spanning tree of } G} x^{i(T)} y^{e(T)}

    Def 3 (deletion-contraction recurrence): For `G` an undirected graph, `G-e`
    the graph obtained from `G` by deleting edge `e`, `G/e` the graph obtained
    from `G` by contracting edge `e`, `k(G)` the number of cut-edges of `G`,
    and `l(G)` the number of loops of `G`:

    .. math::
        T_G(x, y) = \begin{cases}
    	   x^{k(G)} y^{l(G)}, & \text{if all edges are cut-edges or loops} \\
           T_{G-e}(x, y) + T_{G/e}(x, y), & \text{otherwise, for $e$ not a cut-edge or loop}
        \end{cases}

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph

    simplify : bool
        determines if the returned expression will be in simplified form

    Returns
    -------
    instance of :class:`sympy.core.add.Add`
        A Sympy expression representing the Tutte polynomial for `G`.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> C = nx.cycle_graph(5)
    >>> nx.tutte_polynomial_recursive(C)
    x**4 + x**3 + x**2 + x + y

    >>> D = nx.diamond_graph()
    >>> nx.tutte_polynomial_recursive(D)
    x**3 + 2*x**2 + 2*x*y + x + y**2 + y

    Notes
    -----
    This function implements the deletion-contraction recurrence (Definition 3,
    described above). Edge contraction is defined and deletion-contraction is
    introduced in [3]_. Combinatorial meaning of the coefficients is introduced
    in [4]_. Universality, properties, and applications are discussed in [5]_.
